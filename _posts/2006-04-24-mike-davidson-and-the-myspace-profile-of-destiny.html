<p>Mike Davidson has done the unthinkable: make a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mikeindustries">MySpace profile that doesn't make designers' eyes bleed.</a></p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts">Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace</a> for details, then take a look at the discussion on MySpace the great and powerful in <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/myspace-click-factory" title="MySpace: Unstoppable Force or Unnecessary Click Factory?">Unstoppable Force or Unnecessary Click Factory?</a><a href="http://www.myspace.com/mikeindustries" title="MySpace: Unstoppable Force or Unnecessary Click Factory?"><br />
</a><br />
As Mike notes, the profile page design is a bit of a lark, but it may help those of us that previously turned up our noses to suspend judgment sufficiently to properly analyze the site, look more deeply into community design, revenue, and site design issues, such as those covered in Click Factory.</p>
