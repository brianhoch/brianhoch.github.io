<p>As part of their <em>Apple Turns 30</em> coverage, CNET presented a showcase of photos of the early Lisa and Mac interfaces courtesy of Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzfeld.</p>
<p>For a somewhat less garish (and still available in the 2010s) presentation of those same photos fortified with historical notes goodness, check out <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Busy_Being_Born.txt&topic=User%20Interface&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium">Hertzfeld's "Busy Being Born" article on Folklore.org.</a></p>
<p>It's a great look at some of the design decisions as they moved from the Lisa's early softkey approach to the windowed interface we know and love. And considering the graphics capabilities of most computers at the time, those halftones are quite impressive.</p>
