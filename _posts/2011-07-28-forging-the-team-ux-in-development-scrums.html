<p>Last week <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jboogie">Jeff Gothelf</a> wrote a great article on the <a href="http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/what-the-karate-kid-can-teach-us-about-agile-and-ux/">value of involving the UX designer in the development team's daily scrums</a>, pointing to Karate Kid as a way to be patient through the initial run of meetings.</p>
<p>It's great to see someone write this up. It's an approach that we made part of our process at Roundbox GlobalÂ years ago.</p>
<p>Benefits that we saw included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demolish the wall between Design and Development -- no more "us" and "them" with its related miscommunications</li>
<li>Increased teamwork -- everyone interested in making the whole team succeed</li>
<li>Pair designing -- make sure the designs will implement cleanly before documenting, developers point to how we can push the tech to meet design needs</li>
<li>Reciprocal invitation -- involve developers in requirements discussions with the client, especially where technical limits are tight</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this the team enabled itself to move more quickly before changes in requirements and provide software that met the needs of client stakeholders and end users.</p>
