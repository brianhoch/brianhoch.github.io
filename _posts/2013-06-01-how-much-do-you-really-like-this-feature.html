<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/" title="Fast Company" target="_blank">Fast Company</a> posted an article yesterday on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3010972/how-github-uses-deprivation-testing-to-hone-product-design" title="How GitHub Uses \"Deprivation Testing\" To Hone Product Design" target="_blank">GitHub's use of <strong>deprivation testing</strong></a> to verify how much users really want a new feature they've prepared to roll out.</p>
<p>It's a technique that seems obvious once you've heard the idea but I'd never thought to test in this way. Time to think through a pilot test to see if this is as solid a match for testing new features in our systems as I think it is.</p>
<h4>Feeling a lack of natural scrolling</h4>
<p>To Brodigan's point on giving sufficient time for testers to get used to the new feature before taking it away: It took me a while to get used to OS X Lion's "natural scrolling." It took me time to reverse years of muscle memory that told me the new method was backward. Once I got to the other side on muscle memory I found it as natural as the marketing term claims. It's now to the point that using the traditional scrolling gesture in Ubuntu feels so frustrating that I took to the Internet to learn <a href="http://andym3.wordpress.com/2012/05/27/fixing-natural-scrolling-in-ubuntu-12-04/" title="Fixing natural scrolling in Ubuntu 12.04" target="_blank">how to get natural scrolling working in Ubuntu as well.</a> Without giving sufficient time for users to adjust to the new feature we won't get accurate information about whether it hurts to take the new feature away. </p>
<h4>Libraries using this technique for existing services</h4>
<p>In a parallel to Brodigan's point that "deprivation studies actually happen a lot in real life," the <a href="http://www.queenslibrary.org/" title="Queens Library" target="_blank">Queens Library</a> is using deprivation methods to help the communities they serve understand what life would be like without the features they provide through mock funerals like the one they held at their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151617477929485&set=a.401355394484.177863.9126734484&type=1&theater" title="Queens Library mock funeral for Pomonok branch on Facebook" target="_blank">Pomonok branch in Jamaica.</a> This may seem an odd move for a library to make but given that their key argument in encouraging community action is that the libraries "<a href="http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/19/librarycuts_all_2013_05_10_q.html" title="Qns Library could face closures under suggested city budget cuts - Times Ledger" target="_blank">cannot sustain cuts of these proposed levels at a time when they are experiencing some of the highest number of visitors in history,</a>" it may prove effective motivation. My heart and mind respond more clearly to losing something I like or depend on than hearing that an abstract percentage of funds won't be available.</p>
