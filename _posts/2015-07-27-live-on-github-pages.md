With a little effort the Jekyll blog is now live on GitHub pages. The `git` flow using https is much more straightforward than the `ssh` workflow that I used years ago.

The most time consuming steps were copying the blog files into the cloned repo and getting reacquainted with `git`'s add-commit-push workflow to push it all up to GitHub. If I'd have forked an existing repo to start with it would have been even easier.

Something I didn't recognize before moving everything onto GitHub: all the file edits could be done directly on GitHub rather than making changes in a local repository and pushing them up. This opens up the possibility of editing files from a tablet or phone where it wouldn't make sense to use `git`.

I'll have to investigate that in the next couple days to see if it's a pleasant experience. Just because it's possible to create and edit posts directly from GitHub doesn't mean that it's a pleasant experience.
