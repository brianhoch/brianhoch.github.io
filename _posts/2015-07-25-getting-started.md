I've been the slowest about setting up the Jekyll+GitHub pages blog, mostly because I'm not lookig forward to getting into the swing of the `git` workflow to post. While I like the idea of "blogging like a hacker" version control software has never felt natural to me.

In fairness to Jekyll I started up the local server today so I get more days of overlap between the workflows I'm investigating. While `git` is a key part of the Jekyll+GitHub pages workflow it's not the whole thing. It's time to start with the familiar part.

## Pains/Challenges

It will take a little time to get used to writing up the `yaml` front matter for the Jekyll blog but I don't expect that to be a huge deal. I wrote up similar front matter for documents in MultiMarkdown and was going through a similar workflow for Protoc over the weekend.

I've got Jekyll set up but haven't set up GitHub pages yet. That setup in itself looks pretty simple but I keep putting it off because I keep wondering how much trouble it will be to set up the connection and get down the `git` workflow. I was never very fluid with it so I'm finding that intimidating. If anything I think it's that portion of the workflow that would push me to another solution.

## Gains thus far

Working with VIM keystrokes is a plus. It only took a few days to get used to the VIM commands again, in part thanks to an Atom plugin that adds a VIM mode. With that I can use VIM commands on any computer I use, whether I've got VIM itself set up or not.

## Workflows to test

I've decided to focus testing on the following workflows:

### Jekyll+GitHub pages

Since I heard about this approach I liked the underlying ideas of maintaining a static blog. We have the technology to have the computer build the content from simple files then serve it rather than having it build the pages from a database every time someone requests it. That GitHub will serve this for free is an added bonus. 

### Ghost blog platform

I like their "just a blogging engine" philosophy and how they leverage Markdown for writing articles. It feels like an interesting middle ground between Wordpress and Jekyll. It's felt pretty natural thus far. They provide a straightforward admin UI and a live preview of the Markdown you're writing.

### Medium

Medium's reach and philosophy of keeping writing simple makes it important to include in these tests. Editing in the iPhone app was disappointing but the web-based writing tools are promising. 

_We'll see how this goes._
