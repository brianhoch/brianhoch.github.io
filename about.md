I'm Brian Hochhalter. I hope you're enjoying _delcaos_.

I'm a Product Design and Design Operations leader with over 10 years of experience leading digital product design teams as they create effective and delightful experiences for customers and deliver business value to their organizations.

In past lives I've worked as an Information Architect, Director of User Experience, and Director of Education Practice. I’ve worked in the US and Costa Rica with on-site, distributed, and remote teams.

I've worked with clients including [National Geographic Learning](https://ngl.cengage.com/), [Cengage](https://www.cengage.com/), [InterContinental Hotels Group](https://www.ihgplc.com/), [Prevention Research Centers](https://www.cdc.gov/prc/), [National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm), [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/), [Georgia Tech's School of Public Policy](https://spp.gatech.edu/), Lucasfilm, Ltd., Mobium Creative Group, and [Brigham Young University's Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.byu.edu/node).

Outside of work, I’m a husband, father, film buff, tv aficionado, sci-fi fan, gamer, puppeteer, priest, lover of nature, and reader of comic books.
