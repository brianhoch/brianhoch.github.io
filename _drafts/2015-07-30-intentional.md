The intent of investigating blogging engines and finding one I like comes down to wanting to push myself to leverage the value of intentional learning. Writing daily or every few days forces reflection. Given the chllenges I've experienced recently I feel that pushing myself to reflect will be highly beneficial.

And with that, I'm sleepy. There's that other blogging software to try out again. It's nice, works smoothly, just not sure about the performance or where to host it.

It's a conundrum.
