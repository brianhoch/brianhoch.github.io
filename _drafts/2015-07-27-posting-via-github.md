As I post via the GitHub site a couple things stand out.

* GitHub's phone-size UI doesn't include adding a file to the repo, that's only available on the desktop site
* As nice as GitHub's text editor is, it works against Jekyll's key promise: work in your favorite text editor

The first item isn't a big loss, though I was looking forward to doing a quick "I'm doing this stupid thing because I can" style post. That seems more appropriate for Twitter than a blog. Even as a tweet it's altogether too egocentric.

The second isn't a great source of pain but why use GitHub pages instead of a free Tumblr, WordPress, or Medium account if you're going to write posts in a web interface?
